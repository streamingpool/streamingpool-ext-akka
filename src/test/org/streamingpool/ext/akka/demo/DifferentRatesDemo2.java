 * Created by mgalilee on 19/05/2016.
 *
 * Demo of different consumer rates, with the slower one using a conflating mechanism not to backpressure the producer.
 * When run, we can see the 3rd consumer gets only a few elements of the stream, and always the latest.
 * The conflation is also printed, stating which elements are merged.
